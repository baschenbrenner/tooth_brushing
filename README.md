Methods Practice

In constructing a method you will need to keep three things in mind:
1) the definition (def, method name and end)
2) the return - in ruby the return is implicitly the return of the last line of code - what do you want to return?
3) the arguments - what is needed for the method to operate properly?


In this repository you will be constructing a method to represent the action of toothbrushing. You can imagine that there are multiple steps that need to be executed in order. What are these steps?

To represent dynamism, include an argument that shows your best advice for the child on how long they should brush. You would expect the person to input an argument like: "two minutes" or "90 seconds"

Finally, finish with a return other than nil that represents the purpose and deliverable of the tooth brushing.


Extension - if you want to extend this exercise try writing a bin file that you can execute use "ruby bin/methods" in your terminal. You should be able to see the method in action!
